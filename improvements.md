### Suggested Improvements

#### Step 1: Install Node.js and NPM
- **Add a Note on PATH**: For users unsure if the PATH option was correctly added during installation, you can confirm this by restarting the Command Prompt after installation to ensure `node` and `npm` commands are recognized.

#### Step 2: Install MySQL
- **Clarify Setting Up MySQL**: To avoid future errors, suggest setting up a MySQL user specifically for the application, rather than using the `root` user. This improves security:
  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'mean_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mean_stack.* TO 'mean_user'@'localhost';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  ```
  Replace `'mean_user'` and `'password'` with secure options.

- **Mention Starting MySQL as a Service**: Recommend users check that MySQL is set to start automatically on Windows startup by configuring it in the MySQL installer.

#### Step 3: Install Angular CLI
- **Environment Variable Check**: Mention that sometimes a restart of the terminal is needed after a global npm installation to recognize commands like `ng`. This can help avoid issues with the Angular CLI.

#### Step 4: Create a New Angular Project
- **Proxy Setup Later**: Move the proxy setup (Step 6) to be a part of Angular's configuration rather than the initial setup, to avoid potential confusion.

#### Step 5: Install Express and Set Up Node Server
- **Use Environment Variables for Security**: Suggest using environment variables for MySQL credentials instead of hardcoding them. This can be done by creating a `.env` file and using the `dotenv` package:
  ```bash
  npm install dotenv
  ```
  Then, update `app.js`:
  ```javascript
  require('dotenv').config();

  const db = mysql.createConnection({
    host: 'localhost',
    user: process.env.DB_USER,
    password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
    database: 'mean_stack'
  });
  ```
  Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
  ```plaintext
  DB_USER=mean_user
  DB_PASSWORD=your_password
  ```

#### Step 6: Connect Angular and Express
- **Make Proxy Configuration Consistent**: Confirm that the proxy configuration file is located at `src/proxy.conf.json` in Angular, which is where Angular will look by default. 
- **CORS Setup**: If Angular and Express are running on different ports, some setups may require enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in Express, especially for production. Add the `cors` package:
  ```bash
  npm install cors
  ```
  Update `app.js` to include CORS:
  ```javascript
  const cors = require('cors');
  app.use(cors());
  ```
